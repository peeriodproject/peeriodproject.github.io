Please note the following:

1. Peeriod's aim is to make mass traffic observation harder and to protect your privacy when sharing files with complete strangers. For this, Peeriod tries to avoid central certificate authorities (ourselves included). 
Thus your privacy is currently __not__ protected from an active so called [_man-in-the-middle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). This is an attacker who is able to monitor and especially ___adaptively modify___ ___all your network traffic___, usually sitting in your local network. However, Peeriod __does__ protect your privacy from passive eavesdroppers and especially ___other adaptive and curious Peeriod users___.

2. That said, please keep in mind that Peeriod is still an early experiment. 
So until proper review and longtime experience in the field, please be as careful as you always should be.

3. Sharing is caring. Care responsibly.
