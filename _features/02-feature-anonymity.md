Your privacy is our motivation.<br/>
What you download or share with others is noone else's business: 
Your data is routed through other users before it reaches its destination.
As your data is encrypted, nobody on the way knows what is being transferred, where it came from, or where it's bound for.
Thus an eavesdropper has a hard time figuring out what files you are uploading, downloading, or even searching for.
